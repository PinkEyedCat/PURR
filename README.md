# PURR
PURR is a (Work in Progress) E621 CLI Downloader.

Currently using this project for study only and will be working on it most of time.

A lot of things will be changing code-wise as time goes by, but for now is pretty much function, except pools, but searching posts with tags (up to 6 actually) is completly functional

Will be updating both posts and pools sections in Develop branch. So the master is more stable than Develop.
